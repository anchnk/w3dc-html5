==========
W3 Dev Campus HTML5 Course : Web Design Fundamentals - June 2013 Session

This course request doing 4 assignments related to lessons materials. I've set this repository as backup and tracking work-in-progress. Code is comitted 'as is' and shouldn't be considered like code sample or best practice. At the same time, HTML5 is still subject to change and will continue to. So again, warning ! Do not use code from those examples in some production environment.
