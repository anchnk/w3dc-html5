W3 Dev Campus HTML5 June session Assignments

This repository aims to centralize works regarding assignments from the HTML5's june session course.
Seee there : http://classroom.w3devcampus.com/ for more informations.
The course ask to submit 4 assignements.
Nothing fancy, just help to track my progress and allows back and forth files revision history.
So don't expect smart code from here :)
