        This project aims to recreate a classic retro game that reached a broad audience thanks to Nokia. It came ship onboard with old nokia phones and many of them lost some time on this game. This game is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">Snake Game</a>, basically a moving snake eats fruits and grow each time it get feed. If the snake bites is tail or collide against a wall it died and the game start again.

        The code provided isn't optimized at all and shouldn't be consider as an example of a html5 game sample. Moreover, I wanted to recreate data structures that I've used before with Java. More as a challenge for my brain rather than providing a gain of performance. Classes I've recreated are linked list and point class from java. I've just implemented methods I needed for this game and again this is not a smart initiative. I must credit <a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2009/04/13/computer-science-in-javascript-linked-list/">this article</a> that I've used as a starting base.

        I've used samples from the course as well, as the shim for requestAnimationFrame as well as the code for handling keyboard events.

        The game is pretty simple and many things can be enhanced, it's just a basic working example for the HTML5 assignment.

        As an additional challenge, I've used <a href="http://requirejs.org/">requirejs</a> to modularize the javascript code. It's a nice way of thinking and helps clear things as well as the global namespace. I'm still learning it and that's the first project I've done using it.
